This is port of the original Vue Storefront challenge that I did https://github.com/DVT/challenge-vue-storefront-shailen-naidoo but I decided that it would be good for my internal resume to port it over to React even though I have no React experience. Here is the link to the Google Doc for the project with very bare bones mind dump of how I went about this project. https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WXIA3So3sbtUYr0DU_NNDtLhBQU-yx2bczkmvAzY_M/edit?usp=sharing
